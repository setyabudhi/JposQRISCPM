=== Pause

The `org.jpos.transaction.participant.Pause` can be used to slow down
the flow of selected transactions, without consuming TransactionManager's
sessions (it pauses the transaction).

Here is a sample use:

[source,xml]
------------
<participant class="org.jpos.transaction.participant.Pause">
 <property name="timeout" value="5000" />                       <1>
</participant>
------------
<1> Pauses the transaction for 5 seconds

[TIP]
=====
This can be used to slightly delay specific transactions that may
come in bursts (i.e. during a SAF download), such as reversals.
