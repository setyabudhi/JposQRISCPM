== JDBMSpace

JDBMSpace is a persistent space based on the popular http://jdbm.sourceforge.net/[jDBM] key-value lightweight database.

It uses the SpaceFactory prefix +jdbm+ that must be followed by a name, and an optional path, i.e.:

[source,java]
-----
Space sp = SpaceFactory.getSpace("jdbm:myspace");
-----

or

[source,java]
-----
Space sp = SpaceFactory.getSpace("jdbm:myspace:data/myspace");
-----

[TIP]
=====
JDBMSpace is good and we've used it for a long time in production
systems, but now there's a new faster and more reliable implementation,
the +JESpace+ (see <<je_space>>) based on Berkeley DB Java Edition.
