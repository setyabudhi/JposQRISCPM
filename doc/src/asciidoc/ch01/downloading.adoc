== Downloading jPOS
The community edition of jPOS can be downloaded from the
http://jpos.org/download[jPOS Download] page.

A Git repository is hosted at http://github.com/jpos/jPOS[Github].
The repository has many branches and tags. Unless you are dealing with a
legacy jPOS application, you want to use the `master` branch.

If you are looking for older jPOS versions, you can
find them in the http://sourceforge.net/projects/jpos/files/jpos/[SourceForge]
repository, but please note all current development activity is taking place in the
http://github.com/jpos/jPOS[Github] repository, though.
