# Doc build instructions

In order to build jPOS documentation, [AsciiDoctor](http://asciidoctor.org/) needs to be installed.

Then use `gradle createPdf` to create a PDF (which is usually available in [proguide-draft.pdf](http://jpos.org/doc/proguide-draft.pdf) or `gradle viewPdf` to create and view it in your defaul viewer.

You can also try `gradle createHtml` (and `gradle viewHtml`) but the output doesn't look as nice as in PDF format.

You are encouraged to send pull requests with additions, editions and bugfixes to this guide.
