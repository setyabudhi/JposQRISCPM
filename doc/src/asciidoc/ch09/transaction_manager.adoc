== TransactionManager implementation

The +TransactionManager+ is a jPOS Service that monitors a Space queue waiting
for transactions to be processed. These transactions are expected to be any
+Serializable+ objects, but in most jPOS applications those are actually 
+org.jpos.transaction.Context+ objects.

The following image shows a typical scenario:

* A QServer (or a QMUX) receives a message and delegate its handling to an +ISORequestListener+
  implementation
* The +ISORequestListener+ creates an instance of a +Context+, puts there some information relevant
  to the transaction (such as a reference to the received +ISOMsg+ and the originating +ISOSource+)
  and place it in a well known space, using a well known +key+. We use the space as a _queue_
  so we call it _queue_, but it's just a regular entry in the space under a well known name.
* The +TransactionManager+ picks the entry from the space (using a regular +in+ operation) 
  and runs the previously described two-phase commit protocol on the configured participants.

Each participant is instantiated and configured just once by the TransactionManager at
init time, they use the _Flyweight pattern_, but the TransactionManager uses several
simultaneous sessions to handle transactions.

[IMPORTANT]
===========
In the previous paragraph we mention that the TransactionManager uses the
_Flyweight pattern_.  It is extremely important to understand the pattern
before implementing participants. Each participant is instantiated once, but
multiple sessions can run simultaneously. In addition, sessions can be paused
and continued. All session information must be stored in the Context, which the
transaction manager appropriately sets before calling a participant, but *never
ever* in member variables.  
===========

[TIP]
=====
Participants usually don't need a reference to their TransactionManager. 
If required, the participant can implement a method:

`setTransactionManager(TransactionManager tm)` 

that will get called once at initialization time using reflection.
=====

=== TM use of spaces

The TransactionManager uses 3 different spaces for operation.

We see in the previous diagram that the producer (depicted as 'client' in the
image) places entries in a Space, to be consumed by the TransactionManager.

This can be the general purpose _default_ space (`tspace:default`), but in 
high demanding environments, it is possible to define a separate space,
defined as `input-space`.

Internally, it also needs a transient space to keep track of the in-flight
transactions. Again, if not specified, the TransactionManager will use
`tspace:default`, but it is possible to configure a separate space for
that using the `space` property in the XML configuration file.

For recovery purposes, a persistent space (defined with the property
`persistent-space`) is required, i.e.: `je:XXXX` (XXXX being the name
of the space). But taking snapshots to disk reduces the TM speed by
probably an order of magnitude, and many applications that use the
TransactionManager don't take advantage of its recovery features, 
this space defaults to an internal space.

=== Configuration

The TransactionManager is implemented by +org.jpos.transaction.TransactionManager+
but +QFactory.properties+ defines a couple of handy names for it:

* +txnmgr+, or
* +transaction-manager+

So a TM configuration can look like this:

[source,xml]
------------
<txnmgr name="myTM" logger="Q2" realm="TM">
  <property name="queue" value="myTMQueue" />
  ...
  ...
</txnmgr>
------------

or

[source,xml]
------------
<transaction-manager name="myTM" logger="Q2" realm="TM">
  <property name="queue" value="myTMQueue" />
  ...
  ...
</transaction-manager>
------------

[NOTE]
======
The +name+ attribute is not technically required, if ommitted, the transaction manager would
get registered in the +NameRegistrar+ using its root-element name (i.e.: +txnmgr+ or
+transaction-manager+ depending on your configuration). But if you are deploying more than
one TM in the same Q2 instance, the second one would get a +duplicate name+ error, and your
XML QBean descriptor would get renamed to +.DUP+. Using the +name+ attribute with unique
names solves the problem.
======

The TM requires a mandatory property (+queue+) and honors some optional ones, 
which have sensible defaults.

* *queue* +
This is the Space-based _queue_ where the TM looks for transactions to be processed.
As described above, these transactions are actually +Serializable+ objects, typically
an instance of +org.jpos.transaction.Context+. This is a mandatary property.

* *input-space* +
This is the Space where the TransactionManager's sessions wait for transactions
to be queued. It defaults to the default space returned by `SpaceFactory.getSpace()`
that is currently set to `tspace:default`.

* *space* +
Space used by the TransactionManager to handle in-flight transactions. The TM uses
a Space-based circular queue. This Space also uses the system's default, but
in high load systems it is reasonable to consider using a unique space for
each TransactionManager.

* *persistent-space* +
If the application takes advantage of crash recovery features, a persistent
space has to be defined. It can be any persistent space, such as `jdbm` or
the more robust `je` based spaces (i.e. `je:mytm:/path/to/mytm`).

* *recover* +
When the TransactionManager starts, it checks the persistent space for 
in-flight transactions from a previous run. If this feature is not being
used, it is recommended to set `recover` to false (although it doesn't hurt
to keep it on in most situations).

* *debug* +
If true, the TransactionManager logs a small report after each transaction
indicating which participants took place. The log looks like this:

[source,xml]
------------
  <debug>
    txnmgr-1:2
            prepare: org.jpos.jcard.PrepareContext NO_JOIN
            prepare: org.jpos.jcard.CheckVersion READONLY NO_JOIN
            prepare: org.jpos.transaction.Open READONLY NO_JOIN
            prepare: org.jpos.jcard.Switch READONLY NO_JOIN
      groupSelector: notsupported prepareresponse close sendresponse
            prepare: org.jpos.jcard.NotSupported NO_JOIN
            prepare: org.jpos.jcard.PrepareResponse NO_JOIN
            prepare: org.jpos.transaction.Close READONLY
            prepare: org.jpos.jcard.SendResponse READONLY
            prepare: org.jpos.jcard.ProtectDebugInfo READONLY
            prepare: org.jpos.transaction.Debug READONLY
             commit: org.jpos.transaction.Close
             commit: org.jpos.jcard.SendResponse
             commit: org.jpos.jcard.ProtectDebugInfo
             commit: org.jpos.transaction.Debug
    head=3, tail=3, outstanding=0, active-sessions=2/2, tps=0, peak=0, 
    avg=0.00, elapsed=22ms
  </debug>
------------

* *profiler* +
If the profiler property is set to true, in addition to the debug output, the
TransactionManager records the time consumed by each participant callback.
Setting profiler to `true` also sets `debug` to true automatically.

This adds the following information to the log

[source,xml]
------------
  <debug>
    ....
    ....
    <profiler>
      prepare: org.jpos.jcard.PrepareContext [0.0/0.0]
      prepare: org.jpos.jcard.CheckVersion [0.0/0.0]
      prepare: org.jpos.transaction.Open [0.5/0.6]
      prepare: org.jpos.jcard.Switch [0.0/0.6]
      prepare: org.jpos.jcard.NotSupported [0.1/0.7]
      prepare: org.jpos.jcard.PrepareResponse [5.8/6.6]
      prepare: org.jpos.transaction.Close [0.0/6.6]
      prepare: org.jpos.jcard.SendResponse [0.0/6.6]
      prepare: org.jpos.jcard.ProtectDebugInfo [0.0/6.7]
      prepare: org.jpos.transaction.Debug [0.0/6.7]
       commit: org.jpos.transaction.Close [1.0/7.7]
       commit: org.jpos.jcard.SendResponse [4.3/12.0]
       commit: org.jpos.jcard.ProtectDebugInfo [0.2/12.3]
       commit: org.jpos.transaction.Debug [9.3/21.7]
      end [22.8/22.8]
    </profiler>
  </debug>
------------

* *sessions* +
Defines the number of simultaneous sessions (Threads) used to process transactions.
Defaults to one. It is recommended to keep the `sessions` property within a
reasonable value commensurate the number of CPU cores of the system. A
large number here just slows down the capacity of the system.

* *max-sessions* +
In order to deal with occasional traffic spikes (sometimes caused by small
network glitches), the TransactionManager can temporarily increase the
number of sessions. This property defines that maximum. It defaults to
the value set for `sessions`. For obvious reasons, `max-sessions` can't
be less than `sessions`.

* *max-active-sessions* +
When using the TransactionManager _continuations_ feature (where the prepare callback
returns `PAUSE` modifier), it is possible that a small number of sessions
can process a large number of in-flight transactions. Those transactions
may place in the `Context` references to live objects such as JDBC
sessions. In order to place a cap on the number of in-flight transactions
to avoid exhausting resources (for example a JDBC pool), this
`max-active-sessions` property can be set.
The default is 0, which means no limit is imposed.

[TIP]
=====
If you're _pausing_ your transactions, please read the previous paragraph
multiple times and make sure you understand it. 
=====

* *call-selector-on-abort* +
The transaction manager calls the `prepare` method, and then, if the participant
implements the `GroupSelector` interface, it calls its `select` method, regardless
of the result of the `prepare` call. While in practice that's a reasonable and
useful behavior, it can be argued that technically, the TM shouldn't call `select`
if the transaction is bound to abort. We have provided this configuration parameter
that can be set to `false` in order to enable that behavior.


=== TransactionStatusListener

It is possible to monitor a TransactionManager by adding a `TransactionListener`

The interface is very simple:

[source,java]
-------------
public interface TransactionStatusListener extends EventListener {
    public void update (TransactionStatusEvent e);
}
-------------

* see link:http://jpos.org/doc/javadoc/org/jpos/transaction/TransactionStatusListener.html[TransactionStatusListener] and
* link:http://jpos.org/doc/javadoc/org/jpos/transaction/TransactionStatusEvent.html[TransactionStatusEvent]

A `TransactionStatusListener` can be either added dynamically (using the
`TransactionManager.addListener(TransactionStatusListener)` method) or using
XML configuration like this:

[source,xml]
------------
<transaction-manager name="myTM" logger="Q2" realm="TM">
  ...
  ...
  <status-listener class="your.transaction.Listener" />
  ...
  ...
</transaction-manager>
------------

[TIP]
=====
standard logger, realm, and properties can be used.
=====

[NOTE]
======
Calls to the transaction status listener are synchronous, the implementation
is expected to return really fast.
======

The `TMMON` CLI command (see <<cli_commands>>) is an example of a `TransactionStatusListener` interface
and so is the `org.jpos.transaction.gui.TMMonitor` implementation.
