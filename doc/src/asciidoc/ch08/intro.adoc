Before Q2, in the old QSP days, we had a limited set of services
that were migrated to Q2, usually using 'adaptors'.

So the old QSP +channel+ has now the corresponding +channel-adaptor+ service,
+dirpoll+ has a +dirpoll-adaptor+, the +security+ module has a
+SMAdaptor+ and +KeyStoreAdaptor+ and so on.

We document in this chapter these adaptors, along with new services that
have been implemented only in Q2.
