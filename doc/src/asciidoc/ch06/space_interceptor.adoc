== SpaceInterceptor

SpaceInterceptor implements the +Space+ interface and can be used to intercept
calls to a given Space without having to extend its implementation 
(See http://jpos.org/doc/javadoc/org/jpos/space/SpaceInterceptor.html[Javadoc] 
for full details).

Using a +SpaceInterceptor+, the developer can override specific methods in
order to perform aditional tasks.
