== ChannelPool

ChannelPool is an ISOChannel implementation that delegates channel operations
to its children channels.

It can handle several children channels, making it suitable to implement transparent failover.

By using its +addChannel+ and +removeChannel+ methods, you can react to network 
problems on-the-fly without affecting higher-level layers of your application. 

[TIP]
====
As an alternative to the +ChannelPool+, 
Q2 applications can use multiple +ChannelAdaptors+
configured with the same set of Space queues (in/out).
In addition, there's a +MUXPool+ that provides failover as 
well as round-robin load balancing at the MUX level.
