== SpaceUtil

In http://jpos.org/doc/javadoc/org/jpos/space/SpaceUtil.html[SpaceUtil] 
we put together general purpose helper methods that can be used with any 
Space implementation.

* **+inpAll+**
pulls all entries under a given key and return them in an array.

* **+wipe+**
remove all entries under a given key

* **+nextLong+**
When used in combination with a persistent Space (such as +JDBMSpace+
or +JESpace+), this method can be used to easilyl implement sequencers,
i.e:

[source,java]
------------
import org.jpos.space.*;
Space sp = SpaceFactory.getSpace("je:sequencers");
long l = SpaceUtil.nextLong(sp, "traceno");
------------

[TIP]
=====

Regularly monitor this class, as we may add new helper methods in the future.
