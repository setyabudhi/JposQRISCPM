== ChannelAdaptor

When jPOS acts as client from a TCP/IP standpoint, you'd most likely use
the +ChannelAdaptor+ service to manage the low level socket connection.

The +ChannelAdaptor+ uses the Space to communicate with other jPOS
components, basically through two _Space queues_, one for *input*
and the other one for *output*.

The _in_ and _out_ naming convention is easy to remember if
we think of them as *seen from the component's perspective*.

So ChannelAdaptor is monitoring its input (_in_) queue for messages
that are to be sent to the remote host, and places messages received
from the remote host in its output (_out_) queue.

[TIP]
=====
Most of the time, you won't have to deal with these queues,
you'll just deal with the API provided by higher level components
like *QMUX*.

=== QBean descriptor

As described in <<running_Q2>>, Q2 sorts the XML descriptors
available in the +deploy+ directory alphabetically, as an easy
way to orderly start services.

We usually use the prefix **10_** for channels, so that when
other components (such as MUXes that use the prefix '20_') start,
they can use them right away on the first attempt.

So a reasonable name for a channel descriptor can be something like
+10_xxx_channel.xml+.

<channel-adaptor name='your-channel' logger="Q2">         <1>
 <channel class="org.jpos.iso.channel.NACChannel" 
       packager="org.jpos.iso.packager.GenericPackager"   <2>
       header="6000000000">                               <3>
  <property name="packager-config"                        <4>

</channel-adaptor>
------------
<1> The element name +channel-adaptor+ is defined in +QFactory.properties+
    (see <<writing_first_script>>) and implies that the class to
    be instantiated is +org.jpos.q2.iso.ChannelAdaptor+. You can 
    of course use another root element name and add the +class+
    attribute if you wish.
<2> In this example we use the +GenericPackager+ which is the most
    flexible one, but of course, you can use any other custom
    packager or some of the stock packagers such as +XMLPackager+
    or +XML2003Packager+. For a complete list of available
    packagers see link:https://github.com/jpos/jPOS/tree/master/jpos/src/main/java/org/jpos/iso/packager[]
<3> Although not defined in the +ISOChannel+ interface, most channels 
    have a +setHeader(String)+ method. If the +header+ attribute is
    present in the child +channel+ element, ChannelAdaptor will use
    reflection to call it. How this string is interpreted is specific
    to each channel implementation, in this case, +NACChannel+ assumes
    it's getting an hex string.
<4> The +Configuration+ object is available to the packager, provided
    it implements the +Configurable+ interface as it is the case of
    the +GenericPackager+.
<5> The +Configuration+ object is also available to the channel 
    implementation (in this case +NACChannel+ which happens to
    implement the +Configurable+ interface). The host and port
    properties in this case are self explanatory, they point
    to the remote host.
<6> Channel level timeout in milliseconds. If the channel does not
    receive any traffic in the configured timeout, it will disconnect.
    Having a channel level timeout as described here is 
    *highly recommended*.
<7> The +channel+ element can have multiple optional +filter+ 
    child elements (see <<isofilter>>). The +direction+ attribute
    is optional, if not present (or if its value is +both+), 
    the filter is configured to process both incoming as well
    as outgoing messages.
<8> Space queue used to receive messages to be transmitted to the
    remote endpoint.
<9> Messages received from the remote endpoint are placed in
    this queue.
<10> If the connection to the remote host breaks, ChannelAdaptor
    will try to reconnect after a reasonable delay, expressed
    in millis. If this element is not present, a default of
    10 seconds (10000ms) will be used.
=== SSL connections

Most channel implementations accept a socket factory, that can be
configured by adding the properties +socketFactory+ with additional
optional configuration properties required by its implementation.

In case of the provided +org.jpos.iso.SunJSSESocketFactory+, the additional
properties are +storepassword+, +keypassword+ and +keystore+.

The configuration would look like this:

------
 <property name="socketFactory" value="org.jpos.iso.SunJSSESocketFactory" />
 <property name="storepassword" value="password" />
 <property name="keypassword"   value="password" />
 <property name="keystore" value="cfg/mykeystore.ks" />
------

[TIP]
=====
Please note that these properties are specific to the channel, so they go
inside the 'channel' element, not the outer 'channel-adaptor' element.
=====

=== Handling alternate connections

This is not a feature of the ChannelAdaptor but a feature of BaseChannel,
a support class inherited by most channel implementations (but not all of
them, so please check). Channel implementations extending BaseChannel can
take advantage of the +alternate-host+ with its companion +alternate-port+
configuration property. There can be many of those, but the number of
instances have to match (i.e. if you have 4 +alternate-host+ definitions,
you need to have 4 +alternate-port+ definitions).

When ChannelAdaptor calls the +connect+ method in the underlying channel,
BaseChannel will attempt a connection to the main host/port. If that
fails, it will attempt the alternate hosts list.

The configuration looks like this:

------
<channel-adaptor name='your-channel' logger="Q2"> 
 <channel class="org.jpos.iso.channel.NACChannel" 
    ....
    ....
    <property name="alternate-host" value="192.168.1.2" />
    <property name="alternate-host" value="192.168.1.3" />
    <property name="alternate-host" value="192.168.1.4" />
    <property name="alternate-host" value="192.168.1.5" />
    <property name="alternate-port" value="1000" />
    <property name="alternate-port" value="1000" />
    <property name="alternate-port" value="1000" />
    <property name="alternate-port" value="1000" />
    ....
    ....
 </channel>
</channel-adaptor>
------

[TIP]
=====
Same as with the previous SSL socket factory, these properties are 
specific to the channel, so they go inside the 'channel' element, not 
the outer 'channel-adaptor' element.
=====

=== Channel timeout, keep-alive, connection-timeout

We strongly recommend that you add a channel-level timeout (expressed in 
milliseconds). There are many situations where a network connection can
go wrong (i.e. an intermediate firewall may timeout an inactive socket
connection without notify the endpoint). If you know that your link has
to have traffic at least say every minute (i.e. because you're sending
network management 800-class messages back and forth), we recommend that
you set a timeout for say 70 or 80 seconds. 

You can increase that value, but making it very big will have a negative impact
in your application that will learn that a channel is not usable only by the
time it needs to send a real authorization message, causing a reconnection
at that time, instead of ahead of time, while it was idle.

Setting the keep-alive (+true/false+) would set the low level +SO_KEEPALIVE+
flag at the socket level for situations where no network management messages
are exchanged.

The +connection-timeout+ property can be used to set a smaller timeout at
connect time, this is useful when combined with the +alternate-host+ and
+alternate-port+ set of properties.

------
<channel-adaptor name='your-channel' logger="Q2"> 
 <channel class="org.jpos.iso.channel.NACChannel" 
    ....
    ....
    <property name="connection-timeout" value="15000" />  <!-- 15 seconds -->
    <property name="timeout" value="300000" />            <!-- five minutes -->
    <property name="keep-alive" value="true" />
    ....
    ....
 </channel>
</channel-adaptor>
